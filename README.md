# PopularMovies
My final project for the Udacity "Developing Android Apps" course

### The Movie Database API Key is required.
In order for the PopularMovies app to function properly, an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

Use instructions here to obtain the key: http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#

Include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties
'TheMovieDatabaseApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY>"'
